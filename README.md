# UI0Detect in C#
Remake of the UI0Detect.exe. Detects active windows in session 0.

# Remark

With Windows 10 1809, this feature is no longer included and therefore needs to be rebuilt.
This function is very often required in software packaging, because the software is often installed under the SYSTEM account.
